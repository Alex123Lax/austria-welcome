			<h2>Austria's history</h2>
				<img class="picture-square" src="images/logo.jpg" alt="Logo">
				<p>The Central European land that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of Noricum was later claimed by the Roman Empire and made a province. Present-day Petronell-Carnuntum in eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province. Carnuntum was home for 50,000 people for nearly 400 years.</p>

			<h2>Austria's culture</h2>
				<img class="picture-rect" src="images/tracht.jpg" alt="tracht">
				<p>Austrian culture has been influenced by its past and present neighbours: Italy, Poland, Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia.</p>
				<div id="music-section">
					<h3>Music</h3>
						<p>Vienna, the capital city of the 2nd Republic of Austria had long been an important centre of musical innovation. Composers of the 18th and 19th centuries were drawn to the city by the patronage of the Nobility, and made Vienna the European one of the capitals of classical music.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="food-section">
					<h3>Food</h3>
						<p>Austrian cuisine, which is often incorrectly equated with Viennese cuisine, is derived from the cuisine of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In addition to native regional traditions it has been influenced above all by Hungarian, Czech, Jewish and Italian cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="sports-section">
					<h3>Sports</h3>
						<p>Common sports in Austria are football (soccer), skiing, and ice hockey. Since Austria straddles the Alps, it is a prime location for skiing. Austria is the leading nation in the Alpine Skiing World Cup (consistently winning the largest number of points of all countries) and also strong in many other winter sports such as ski jumping. Austria's national ice hockey team ranks 13th in the world.</p>
